# fast-api

made the api to perform crud operations using fastapi and sqlalchemy 

you can also use the swagger ui of fastapi to view the documentation of this api after running it using "uvicorn main:app --reload" in the terminal of code editor

you just need to type "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" I was using port 8000 so its 8000
